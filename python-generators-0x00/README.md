# Python Generators: Efficient Data Processing

This project demonstrates advanced usage of Python generators to efficiently handle large datasets, process data in batches, and simulate real-world scenarios involving live updates and memory-efficient computations. By leveraging Python's `yield' keyword and integrating SQL databases, this project provides a hands-on learning experience in optimizating performance in data-driven applications.
